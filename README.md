# ChatCapture

ChatCapture is a program intended for use by roleplayers on the Age of Ruin MC server, it captures chat from the MC window when you type a specific command.


# Usage

To use ChatCapture, simply open the .exe while being logged on to Age of Ruin, and type in IC chat !savemessage [Number of minutes you wish to capture], e.g: !savemessage 10 saves messages sent in the last ten minutes.

## Known issues

There might be issues with playing throughout two different days, if the RP extends through midnight, I would recommend taking two different captures, one before and one after midnight.
I'm not sure if this is compatible with Mac/Linux as of yet.
